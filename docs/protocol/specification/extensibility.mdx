# 8. Extensibility and Customization - HugAI v2 Specification

This section describes how the HugAI v2 protocol can be extended and customized to adapt to new needs, agents, capabilities, and scenarios.

---

## 8.1. Principles of Extensibility

- The protocol is designed to be modular and evolutionary.
- It allows the addition of new message types, capabilities, agents, and workflows without breaking existing compatibility.
- It is recommended to follow naming conventions and document all extensions.

---

## 8.2. Adding New Message Types or Capabilities

- **New messages:** Additional methods can be defined following the JSON-RPC scheme, for example: `agent/customAction`, `tool/notify`, etc.
- **New capabilities:** Agents can announce additional capabilities in their registration (`capabilities`), for example: `"code-review": true`.
- **New agents:** Simply register the agent and its capabilities, following the standard flow.

## 8.3. Extension Example (Custom Message)

**Definition of a new message for security analysis:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "agent/securityScan",
  "params": {
    "target": "main.ts",
    "level": "deep"
  },
  "id": 10
}
```

**The agent can announce the new capability:**
```json
{
  "agentId": "security-agent-1",
  "capabilities": { "security-scan": true }
}
```

---

## 8.4. Best Practices for Extension and Compatibility

- Use clear prefixes for custom methods (`agent/`, `tool/`, `governance/`, etc.).
- Document each extension and its purpose.
- Maintain backward compatibility whenever possible.
- Validate extensions before deploying them in critical environments.
- Share useful extensions with the community for possible standardization.

---

## 8.5. Interoperability and Modularity

- Extensions should be optional and negotiable between agents and the system.
- Agents are recommended to ignore unknown messages/fields unless they are critical.
- Modularizing capabilities and workflows facilitates integration with other systems and protocol evolution.

> **Note:** Extensibility is key to the evolution of the protocol. It is recommended to keep a record of extensions and promote interoperability between implementations.
