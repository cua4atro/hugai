# Agents and Roles in HugAI

> **Note:** This document complements the HugAI methodology and specification, detailing the types of agents, their roles, capabilities, and collaboration examples.

## Types of Specialized Agents

| Agent Type           | Description                                                      | Example Tasks/Capabilities                |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Analysis**         | Analyze requirements, context, and project needs                 | Requirements extraction, validation, prompt refinement, domain analysis |
| **Design**           | Propose architectures, models, and solution paths                | Architecture design, data modeling, API definition, task routing     |
| **Implementation**   | Generate code, integrate APIs, write documentation               | Code generation, service integration, automatic documentation           |
| **Quality**          | Evaluate and improve software quality                            | Test generation and execution, security analysis, code review, performance |
| **Operations**       | Manage deployments, monitoring, and maintenance                  | Deployment, CI/CD, monitoring, maintenance, observability                |
| **Governance**       | Oversee compliance, risks, and critical points                   | Compliance, risk management, auditing, approval management, escalation     |

## Concrete Examples of Agents and Collaboration

- **Requirements Analyzer**: Extracts and validates requirements from user descriptions.
- **Domain Expert**: Provides domain-specific knowledge (e.g., health, finance).
- **Prompt Refiner**: Optimizes prompts for generative agents.
- **Architecture Agent**: Proposes and validates software architectures.
- **Router Agent**: Assigns tasks to the most suitable agent according to context.
- **Code Generator**: Generates source code from specifications.
- **Integration Agent**: Manages integration of APIs and external services.
- **Documentation Writer**: Generates technical and user documentation.
- **Test Agent**: Creates and executes unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- **Security Agent**: Performs vulnerability analysis and policy compliance.
- **Performance Agent**: Evaluates performance and proposes optimizations.
- **Code Reviewer**: Reviews the quality and style of generated code.
- **Deployment Agent**: Automates deployment in different environments.
- **DevOps Agent**: Orchestrates CI/CD pipelines and operations.
- **Maintenance Agent**: Monitors system health and applies patches.
- **Observability Agent**: Configures and monitors metrics and logs.
- **Compliance Agent**: Verifies regulatory and compliance adherence.
- **Risk Management Agent**: Assesses risks and proposes mitigations.
- **Escalation Manager**: Manages critical incidents and escalations.

## Example of Collaboration and Workflows

1. **Typical development flow:**
   - *Requirements Analyzer* extracts requirements → *Architecture Agent* designs the solution → *Code Generator* implements → *Test Agent* validates → *Code Reviewer* reviews → *Deployment Agent* deploys.
2. **Governance checkpoints:**
   - *Compliance Agent* and *Risk Management Agent* may require human approval before proceeding.
   - *Escalation Manager* intervenes if there are critical incidents.
3. **Dynamic collaboration:**
   - *Router Agent* can reassign tasks based on availability or specialization.
   - *Observability Agent* and *Maintenance Agent* collaborate to maintain system health.

> **Note:** Agents can be implemented as independent services, modules, or integrations, and their collaboration is orchestrated by the HugAI protocol, respecting governance levels and defined checkpoints.
