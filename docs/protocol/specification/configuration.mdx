# 5. Configuration and Variables - HugAI v2 Specification

This section describes how to configure the system, agents, and key variables in the HugAI v2 protocol.

---

## 5.1. General Description

Configuration in HugAI v2 allows adapting the behavior of agents, clients, and the central system. It can be managed through files (JSON/YAML), environment variables, or runtime parameters.

## 5.2. Global and Environment Variables

| Variable            | Type     | Description                                               |
|---------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| governanceLevel     | string   | Governance level: autonomous, supervised, human-in-the-loop |
| workspaceFolders    | string[] | Associated workspace folder paths                          |
| capabilities        | object   | Enabled capabilities for the agent or system              |
| logging.level       | string   | Log level: error, warn, info, debug, trace                |
| logging.path        | string   | Path to the log file                                      |
| integration.tools   | object[] | Integrated external tools                                 |
| agentId             | string   | Unique identifier for the agent                           |
| agentSecret         | string   | Token/key for authentication (if applicable)              |
| environment         | string   | Environment: development, staging, production             |

## 5.3. Example Configuration File (JSON)

```json
{
  "agentId": "demo-agent-1",
  "governanceLevel": "supervised",
  "workspaceFolders": ["/project/demo"],
  "capabilities": {
    "code-generation": true,
    "testing": true,
    "refactoring": false
  },
  "logging": {
    "level": "info",
    "path": "./logs/agent.log"
  },
  "integration": {
    "tools": [
      { "name": "ci-pipeline", "enabled": true },
      { "name": "static-analysis", "enabled": false }
    ]
  },
  "environment": "development"
}
```

## 5.4. Key Parameters

- **governanceLevel**: Defines the degree of human intervention. Typical values:
  - `autonomous`: The agent acts without human intervention.
  - `supervised`: Requires reviews or approvals at critical points.
  - `human-in-the-loop`: Every relevant action requires human approval.

- **workspaceFolders**: Working directories operated on by the agent.

- **capabilities**: Enabled functionalities (e.g., code-generation, testing, refactoring).

- **logging**: Log configuration for auditing and debugging.

- **integration.tools**: External tools available to the agent.

- **agentId / agentSecret**: Identifiers and credentials for authentication and traceability.

- **environment**: Allows adapting behavior according to the environment (development, production, etc.).

---

## 5.5. Best Practices for Configuration Management

- Use versioned and validated configuration files.
- Separate sensitive credentials (e.g., agentSecret) using environment variables.
- Document all parameters and possible values.
- Validate configuration at startup and upon dynamic changes.
- Allow parameter overrides via command line or environment variables.
- Keep configuration modular to facilitate extension and customization.

> **Note:** Configuration may evolve according to the needs of the system and agents. It is recommended to maintain backward compatibility and document changes.
