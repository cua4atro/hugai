# Lifecycle Phases

The HugAI methodology structures the software development lifecycle into the following main phases, each supported by specialized AI agents and human control checkpoints:

1. **Planning**
   - Definition of objectives, scope, requirements, and project success criteria. Analysis agents, requirements refinement agents, and domain experts participate, always validated by human stakeholders.
2. **Design**
   - Architecture, component design, technology selection, and interface definition. Architecture and design agents collaborate with humans to propose and validate solutions.
3. **Implementation**
   - Code development, module integration, and artifact generation. Code generation, integration, and documentation agents assist developers, under human review and approval.
4. **Testing and Validation**
   - Automated and manual testing, quality, security, and performance analysis. Testing, security, and performance agents generate and execute tests, reporting findings for human review.
5. **Deployment**
   - Preparation and execution of deployment in production or staging environments. DevOps and deployment agents automate processes, but key milestones require human approval.
6. **Maintenance and Evolution**
   - Monitoring, support, bug fixing, and system evolution. Maintenance and observability agents detect incidents and propose improvements, which are prioritized and validated by the human team.

Each phase includes governance checkpoints where human intervention, review, or approval is required, thus ensuring quality, security, and alignment with project objectives.
