# Limitations

Although the HugAI methodology offers a robust framework, it is important to consider its limitations:

- **Dependence on the quality of AI models:** The results and recommendations of the agents depend on the accuracy and updating of the underlying models.
- **Requires organizational maturity:** Effective adoption demands teams willing to collaborate and adapt to new processes and technologies.
- **Does not replace expert judgment:** AI is a complement, not a substitute for human knowledge and experience, especially in critical or ambiguous contexts.
- **Possible biases and errors:** Agents may inherit data biases or make mistakes; therefore, human supervision is indispensable.
- **Implementation and maintenance costs:** Integrating and maintaining AI agents may require investment in infrastructure, training, and continuous updating.
- **Regulatory and ethical compliance:** The methodology must be adapted to the legal and ethical requirements of each industry or region.
