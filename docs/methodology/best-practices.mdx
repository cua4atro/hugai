# Best Practices

For effective adoption and use of the HugAI methodology, it is recommended to:

1. **Clearly define roles and responsibilities** from the start of the project.
2. **Select the appropriate governance level** for each task according to its criticality and risk.
3. **Document all decisions and actions** taken by agents and humans to ensure traceability and auditability.
4. **Promote continuous training** of human teams in the use of AI and in interpreting its results.
5. **Periodically review and update workflows** and governance rules based on experience and lessons learned.
6. **Promote collaboration and open communication** among all participants, humans and agents.
7. **Assess and mitigate ethical and security risks** before automating critical tasks.
8. **Use metrics and feedback** to continuously improve the integration and performance of AI agents.
