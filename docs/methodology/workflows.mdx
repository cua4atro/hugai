# Workflows

In HugAI, workflows are based on the dynamic orchestration between AI agents and humans, ensuring that each task passes through the appropriate control and validation points:

1. **Start and Assignment**
   - A human or agent initiates the workflow, defines the objective, and assigns tasks to the corresponding specialized agents.
2. **Collaborative Execution**
   - Agents perform automated tasks (analysis, code generation, testing, etc.) and report results or recommendations.
   - Humans review, validate, or request adjustments to the results generated by the AI.
3. **Governance Checkpoints**
   - At key points in the workflow, human intervention is required to approve, reject, or request revisions before moving to the next phase.
4. **Escalation and Incident Resolution**
   - If an agent detects a problem beyond its scope, it escalates the incident to a human or a governance agent for resolution.
5. **Closure and Feedback**
   - At the end of the workflow, results, lessons learned, and improvement opportunities are documented to provide feedback to the system and agents.

This model allows for flexibility, adaptability, and control, ensuring that automation never replaces human supervision and judgment, but rather enhances them.
