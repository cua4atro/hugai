# Types of Agents

The methodology HugAI defines several types of AI agents, each specialized in a phase or function of the development lifecycle:

1. **Analysis Agents**
   - Refine requirements, analyze needs, and validate the project context (e.g., Requirements Analyzer, Domain Expert, Prompt Refiner).
2. **Design Agents**
   - Propose architectures, design components, and define interfaces (e.g., Architecture Agent, Router Agent).
3. **Implementation Agents**
   - Generate code, integrate modules, and produce technical documentation (e.g., Implementation Agent, Integration Agent, Documentation Writer).
4. **Quality Agents**
   - Generate and execute tests, analyze security and performance, review code (e.g., Test Agent, Security Agent, Performance Agent, Internal Reviewer).
5. **Operations Agents**
   - Automate deployments, monitor systems, and manage maintenance (e.g., Deployment Agent, DevOps Agent, Maintenance Agent, Observability Agent).
6. **Governance Agents**
   - Oversee compliance, manage risks, and escalate incidents (e.g., Compliance Agent, Risk Management Agent, Escalation Manager).

Each agent operates under governance rules and collaborates with humans and other agents to maximize value and security in each phase of the lifecycle.
