# Fundamental Principles

The guiding principles of the HugAI methodology are:

1. **Transparency**
   - All actions, decisions, and recommendations of AI agents must be traceable, auditable, and understandable to the humans involved.
2. **Human Control**
   - Humans retain final authority over critical decisions, being able to accept, reject, or request revisions to AI proposals.
3. **Collaboration**
   - Synergy between human teams and AI agents is promoted, leveraging the strengths of both to achieve better results.
4. **Accountability**
   - Every action taken by agents or humans must be clearly attributed, allowing accountability and regulatory compliance.
5. **Adaptability**
   - The methodology must be able to adjust to different contexts, domains, and levels of technological maturity, facilitating progressive adoption.
6. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Feedback and learning are encouraged for both agents and human teams, to iteratively evolve processes and results.
7. **Security and Ethics**
   - The integration of AI must be carried out respecting ethical and security principles, minimizing risks and preventing biases or misuse.
